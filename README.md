## Title: EDA on Solar Radiation Measurement Data

## Overview
This project involves analyzing solar energy data to explore relationships between solar radiation components, temperature, relative humidity, 
and wind conditions. The analysis includes various visualizations, including histograms, scatter plots, bubble charts, and correlation matrices,
to better understand the dynamics of solar energy generation.

## Contents
Data Analysis:
Moving averages for time series analysis.

Trend analysis of solar radiation and temperature.

Correlation analysis between solar radiation, temperature, and humidity.

Wind analysis using wind roses and radial bar plots.

Histogram visualizations for frequency distributions of key variables.

## Visualizations:
Bubble charts illustrating complex relationships between variables.

Histograms for GHI, DNI, DHI, wind speed, and temperatures.
